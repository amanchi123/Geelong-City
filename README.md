# Geelong-City

In this project, the main  aim is to implement train station
prediction system for the Geelong city suburbs by finding various influential factors.
With the predicted growth of population and current train timings the squad have aimed
at predicting timetable for Geelong City train station for the year 2030. The squad has
been divided into two groups: Machine Learning Team and Website Development Team.
The two teams have worked in sync to achieve the aimed deliverables on time. The
geelongbuiltenv.csv dataset has been used by both the teams to make predictions and the
data has been visualized using Power BI which helps us to understand the attributes.
Machine learning team has applied neural network algorithm to predict new train station
and Django a python-based framework has been used by Website Development team for
creating the website.

Machine learning algorithms used:
Since the problem was to predict the presence of train station i.e. classification problem, we
chose supervised learning algorithms such as SVM, KNN and Neural network.
In depth analysis of these algorithms are provided in the following sections. The results
obtained by using each of these algorithms are also provided.
We found out that, the neural network using LSTM and Dense layers provided more accurate
results than the other two algorithms.
